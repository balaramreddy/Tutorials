installing angular cli and run angular app?
------------------------------------------------
    node -v
    npm -v
        npm install npm@latest -g

    CLI - Command Line Interface

    To install the Angular cli ;
        - npm install -g @angular/cli          --> I have installed this earlier.
        - npm install -g @angular/cli@latest   --> by using this command we can get the updated angular/cli version.
        - npm i -g @angular/cli

    To uninstall the Angular/cli:
        - npm uninstall @angular/cli 
        - npm uninstall -g @angular/cli 

        here -g represents globally

            prefix with double dash (--) represents - optional names
            prefix with single dash (-) represents - optional aliases

        - npm cache verify  - to verify the cache
        - npm cache clean
            whenever we install a package with command npm install<package> ,npm stores the cache inside the user file system.
            Default directory where the cache data is stored on windows is 
            C:\Users\name\AppData\Roaming\npm-cache

            so we need to clean the cache first
            cache can be clean by using the above command.

    To check the current version of Angular cli
        - ng version


    ng new my-dream-app
    cd my-dream-app
   
    ng serve 
    ng serve -o
    ng serve --port 3000 -o	/ng serve --port=4300					===> to run on differnet port number

installing bootstrap framework
-------------------------------
    npm install bootstrap --save          		==> To install bootstarp in to app 
	npm install bootstrap@next --save			==>to get next latest version

    after intsall bootsrap check wheather boostrap is install or not install in (package.json - dependencies )

    then add path to angular.json

    npm i bootstarp jquery propper --save 
					
					 "styles": [
					  "src/styles.css",
					  "node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
					],
					"scripts": [
					  "node_modules/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js",
					  "node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"
					]

angular folder strecture and bootprocess
-------------------------------------------
    E2E - end to end scripts will be resuding
           - to run end to end test cases we used protractor-framework 
                we also used jasmin(language it used for unit testing) and karma runner
                
           - app.po.ts - it is protractor file which will have "po" file
           - app.e2e.spec.ts 
                e2e - tells that this scripts is end to end function test script
                spec - whenever spec added that means that it is test script
    
    node_modules
        new package install in it
        this is folder where all modules and libraries resides
        add/remove modules/packages
        we will not touch this folder for development purpose

    src 
    ------
        this is the main workarea/app code resides inside the folder
        this is the basic foder strecture
        app folder is the place where you will see components,modules, directives,services,pipes etc
        
        app.components.ts [where you see components - it means that file corresponds to a component]
        
        app.module.ts [it means these are service files]
            Module can import or exports the code as required and finally render the view in browser
       
        app.service.ts
            Service contain the business logic

    assets
        icons,images,styles

    env 
        configure variables pipelines for dev test,stage,and prod

    polyfills
         if the user browser is outdated one pollyfills will add thw backword functionality

    main.ts 
        booting the angular application

        bootprocess
        this is the first file that angular will check to load start an angular application
        we need atleast one module present to be present in our main.ts
        by default the module that's inside the main.ts is - appmodule

        bootsrapmodule is the on ewhich loads and starts the application
        this is not related to bootstrap framework 

        yes we can change the default app module to something else
            we can write custom module and then load into bootsrapmodule
    
    test.ts
        test scripts for booting process
        all the code inside main.ts is tested here in this file
    
    style.css
        global stylesheet
        dont make it heavy
        generic/common typography, fonts, styles
    
    angular.json
       this is the file for all configuration of our angular project
    
    karma.conf.js
        karma runner for running our unit test scripts
        config our test scripts

    tslint.json
        linting or coading standards indentation, semicolon, where it is strat and end

    ts confing.json 
        build and compilation related to angular application

   
   package.json and pacakge.lock.json
   ----------------------------------
   import for interview
   import for developer and qa need to understsand how to work
   
    package.json
        to understand any existing angular application always refer to package.json to see the scripts

    semantic versioning
        Three major components (10.0.1)
            Major (10) 
            Minor (0)
            Patch (1)

        npm run start  

    package.lock.json
    - we can see all indetail details about packages
    
    how does angular application works
        -> Every Angular app consists of a file named angular.json.
        -> This file will contain all the configurations of the app.
        -> While building the app, the builder looks at this file to find the entry point of the application. 
        -> Inside the build section entry point of application is Main.ts
        -> The main.ts file creates a browser environment to run the application, along with this it also calls a function bootstrap Module, which bootstraps the application
